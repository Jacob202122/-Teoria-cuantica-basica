### Example 4.5.2

Let us work on the simplest nontrivial two-particle system: each particle is allowed only two points. Consider the state

$$
|\psi\rangle = |x_0\rangle \otimes |y_0\rangle + |x_1\rangle \otimes |y_1\rangle. \tag{4.103}
$$

In order to clarify what is left out, we might write this as

$$
|\psi\rangle = 1|x_0\rangle \otimes |y_0\rangle + 0|x_0\rangle \otimes |y_1\rangle + 0|x_1\rangle \otimes |y_0\rangle + 1|x_1\rangle \otimes |y_1\rangle. \tag{4.104}
$$

Let us see if we can write \( |\psi\rangle \) as the tensor product of two states coming from the two subsystems. Any vector representing the first particle on the line can be written as

$$
c_0 |x_0\rangle + c_1 |x_1\rangle. \tag{4.105}
$$

Similarly, any vector representing the second particle on the line can be written as

$$
c_0 |y_0\rangle + c_1 |y_1\rangle. \tag{4.106}
$$

Therefore, if \( |\psi\rangle \) came from the tensor product of the two subsystems, we would have

$$
(c_0 |x_0\rangle + c_1 |x_1\rangle) \otimes (c_0 |y_0\rangle + c_1 |y_1\rangle) = c_0 c_0 |x_0\rangle \otimes |y_0\rangle + c_0 c_1 |x_0\rangle \otimes |y_1\rangle + c_1 c_0 |x_1\rangle \otimes |y_0\rangle + c_1 c_1 |x_1\rangle \otimes |y_1\rangle.
$$
